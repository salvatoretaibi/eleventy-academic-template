<!-- excerpt -->
Cities are alive. As much as I love my time in the mountains, far removed from civilization and the frenetic pace of everyday life, the city moves with a different rhythm. Movement and time. You become intensely aware of time. It ceaseless nature is omnipresent: the pedestrians on the streets, the trains below your feet, the shadows of the buildings. The ebbs and flows of offices and businesses and schools. All of these things never let you forget how life is one long slide into oblivion. We are here and then we are gone. Maybe someone remembers, but probably not.  

There are so many cities, but not all of them have called to my lens. I have wandered the streets of urban landscapes around the globe, yet in some I never even lift the camera to my eye. There are some, however, where I can't put the camera down. The first? New York. My original love.

Growing up across the river, the skyline was always there, always looming, always calling. The profile was much different back then, and you could see it and appreciate its cohesive grandeur. Still, you couldn't *feel* it. You had to be within its confines to sense its pulse, to hear its beating heart. We went every chance we could.

The architecture has changed over time. It has become colder and uninviting. It seems as if building designers have chosen to forget the past. Each tries to outdo the other by making the next project thinner, taller, and more ethereal. Sadly, they have forgotten NYC is *not* a delicate city. It is a fortress. An iron lung. Give me brick and mortar. 

Give me heavy. There is something in brick. It is warm, strong, comforting. All those bricks in a Manhattan of a bygone era. Now we get steel and glass. Eyesores, I say. Save those ideas for "Tomorrow World."
