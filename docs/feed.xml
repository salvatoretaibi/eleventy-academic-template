    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Where to begin? Times, they are a changin&#39;.
It&#39;s easy to take for granted all of the technology available at our fingertips today, therefore I find it useful to occasionally stop and think back to a different time. A time before all of this. A time when messages were sent in envelopes, a stamp neatly affixed in the upper right corner, senders and recipients both eager with anticipation. A walk to retrieve one&#39;s mail from a PO Box in the Rutgers&#39; Post Office (does it still exist?), hoping grandma sent a few dollars hidden inside a meticulously folded letter telling you to treat yourself to a meal but full-well knowing it was going to be spent on beer. What does grandma do now? Venmo? Bitcoin? The remarkable thing is all of this wasn&#39;t so long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, enough looking back. Let&#39;s cast our eyes forward. This is exciting. I wish I had a nickle for every time I&#39;ve heard: &amp;quot;Digital Humanities... That&#39;s the future.&amp;quot; Nevertheless, there certainly is a lot of truth in those words. The modern American landscape is soaked with opportunity. Anyone can publish their words and images on the web. All the tools are available open-source. Kids are given tablets and laptops at school, wifi is broadcast through the air. It&#39;s all free. Barriers to entry are disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not sure what role DH will play in my own work--mostly because I have no real idea of where I&#39;m going--but I know it will be a factor. I&#39;m already thinking of the possibilities of writing papers about cinema where clips are embedded and the reader can easily &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; what the article is referring to without having to search for the movie. My son would love nothing more than if I started included memes in my work. Perhaps that is how the two of us will collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting to figure some of this out. The future&#39;s bright.&lt;/p&gt;

Cities are alive. As much as I love my time in the mountains, far removed from civilization and the frenetic pace of everyday life, the city moves with a different rhythm. Movement and time. You become intensely aware of time. It ceaseless nature is omnipresent: the pedestrians on the streets, the trains below your feet, the shadows of the buildings. The ebbs and flows of offices and businesses and schools. All of these things never let you forget how life is one long slide into oblivion. We are here and then we are gone. Maybe someone remembers, but probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many cities, but not all of them have cried out to my lens. I have wandered the streets of urban landscapes around the globe, yet in some I never even lift the camera to my eye. There are some, however, where I can&#39;t put the camera down. The first? New York. My original love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up across the river, the skyline was always there, always looming, always calling. The profile was much different back then, and you could see it and appreciate its cohesive grandeur. Still, you couldn&#39;t &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; it. You had to be within its confines to sense its pulse, to hear its beating heart. We went every chance we could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The architecture has changed over time. It has become colder and uninviting. It seems as if building designers have chosen to forget the past as each tries to outdo one another by making the next project thinner, taller, and more ethereal. Sadly, they have forgotten NYC is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a delicate city. It is a fortress. An iron lung. Give me brick and mortar. Give me heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something in brick. Warm, strong, comforting. All those bricks in a Manhattan of a bygone era. Now we get steel and glass. Eyesores, I say. Save those ideas for &amp;quot;Tomorrow World.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
