    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Where to begin? Times, they are a changin&#39;.
It&#39;s easy to take for granted all of the technology available at our fingertips today, therefore I find it useful to occasionally stop and think back to a different time. A time before all of this. A time when messages were sent in envelopes, a stamp neatly affixed in the upper right corner, senders and recipients both eager with anticipation. A walk to retrieve one&#39;s mail from a PO Box in the Rutgers&#39; Post Office (does it still exist?), hoping grandma sent a few dollars hidden inside a meticulously folded letter telling you to treat yourself to a meal but full-well knowing it was going to be spent on beer. What does grandma do now? Venmo? Bitcoin? The remarkable thing is all of this wasn&#39;t so long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, enough looking back. Let&#39;s cast our eyes forward. This is exciting. I wish I had a nickle for every time I&#39;ve heard: &amp;quot;Digital Humanities... That&#39;s the future.&amp;quot; Nevertheless, there certainly is a lot of truth in those words. The modern American landscape is soaked with opportunity. Anyone can publish their words and images on the web. All the tools are available open-source. Kids are given tablets and laptops at school, wifi is broadcast through the air. It&#39;s all free. Barriers to entry are disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not sure what role DH will play in my own work--mostly because I have no real idea of where I&#39;m going--but I know it will be a factor. I&#39;m already thinking of the possibilities of writing papers about cinema where clips are embedded and the reader can easily &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; what the article is referring to without having to search for the movie. My son would love nothing more than if I started included memes in my work. Perhaps that is how the two of us will collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting to figure some of this out. The future&#39;s bright.&lt;/p&gt;

The city is a an urban landscape. As much as I love my time in the mountains, far removed from civilization and the frenetic pace of everyday life, there is so much beauty in the city. Each one is different, each has its own character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should probably start at the beginning. New York. Growing up across the river, the skyline was always there, always looming, always calling. The city&#39;s profile was so much different back then. The Empire State Building anchored midtown, and the Twin Towers marked the island&#39;s end.&lt;/p&gt;
